# Chapter 2: Creating A Hello World App

Creating a "Hello World" app in Flutter is a great way to get started with mobile development. First, you’ll need to set up the Flutter environment by installing the Flutter SDK and an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. Once that’s done, you can create a new project with a simple command, flutter create Hello World, which generates all the basic files for you. In the lib/main.dart file, you’ll write a basic Flutter app using a stateless widget.

The core of the app is the MaterialApp, which gives the app its structure, and within it, you use a Scaffold to add an app bar and a body. The body itself holds a Text widget that displays "Hello, World!" in the center of the screen. This simple setup helps you understand how Flutter uses widgets to build the user interface. Once everything is in place, you can run the app on either an emulator or a real device and see your "Hello, World!" message come to life.
